# integerAxioms

This project tries to prove properties of the natural numbers from a list of axioms (things that are assumed to be true).

This was part of PROMYS Europe 2021 and their philosophy of building everything from the ground up.
We were given "PODASIP" ("prove or disprove and salvage if possible") questions, and had to come up with our own axioms (not including rules of equality or logic) to try and solve them.

If we encountered a problem we could not solve with our current set of axioms, we would add another axiom, and if we could prove an axiom with other axioms, it need not be an axiom (the idea is minimal set of axioms)

Everything proved builds on more basic results which in turn build on results that can be proved from the axioms - so everything can be logically proved from the axioms and we are essentially building a skyscraper from basic building blocks.
